# Coding Quiz Challenge

## Description
This project is a coding quiz that allows the user to test their knowledge of coding concepts. The quiz includes multiple choice questions and a timer, and the user's score is affected by the amount of time it takes them to complete the quiz as well as the number of incorrect answers. The quiz has a start screen, an end screen where the user can enter their initials and submit their score, and a separate high scores page where the user can view the top scores. The quiz also includes a feature to clear the high scores.

# Challenges

At the beginning I found it straight-forward as I have made a pseudocode in my head and already had some steps to start with. However, I realised that later on, the struggle was real. My main challenges and ideas were as follows:

1. Understanding how the Document Object Model (DOM) works: I struggled to understand how the DOM works, and how I could use JavaScript to manipulate elements in the HTML page. I ended up doing more research and practicing with different DOM methods to get a better understanding.

2. Displaying the questions as soon as the start button is pressed: I had trouble getting the questions to display as soon as the start button was pressed. It took me a while to figure out how to use JavaScript to show the questions and hide the start screen.

3. Saving and displaying the high scores: I struggled to get the high scores to display on the high scores page, even though I was able to save them to local storage. It took me a bit of time to figure out how to retrieve the scores from local storage and display them in the correct format.

# The Journey

The below screenshots are from the entire journey with the finished project

1. Start from the HTML & CSS structure for the quiz, including the start screen, and end screen.

2. Write the questions and answer choices in a separate JavaScript file (questions.js).

3. Set up the script.js file to handle the logic of the quiz, including starting the quiz, displaying questions and choices, checking answers, and handling the end of the quiz.

4. Use the localStorage API to save and retrieve the user's high scores.

5. Test the quiz to make sure everything is working as expected.
